// Test file to demonstrate signup console logs and redirect functionality
// This file shows what will happen when a user signs up

/*
ENHANCED SIGNUP FUNCTIONALITY:

1. CONSOLE LOGS ADDED:
   🚀 Signup process started
   📝 Form data: { name, email }
   ✅ Validation passed, dispatching register action
   👤 User data being sent: { name, email }
   📤 Register action dispatched successfully
   🎉 Registration successful!
   👤 User data: [user object]
   🔄 Redirecting to home page...
   ✅ Redirect completed

2. VALIDATION LOGS:
   ❌ Validation failed: Missing fields
   ❌ Validation failed: Password too short
   ❌ Validation failed: Passwords don't match

3. ERROR LOGS:
   ❌ Registration failed
   💬 Error message: [error details]

4. STATE TRACKING:
   🔍 Register Component State: {
     isLoading: true/false,
     isSuccess: true/false,
     isError: true/false,
     isLoggedIn: true/false,
     justRegistered: true/false,
     hasUser: true/false
   }

5. REDIRECT BEHAVIOR:
   - BEFORE: navigate("/login") - redirected to login page
   - NOW: navigate("/") - redirects to home page after successful signup
   - SUCCESS MESSAGE: "Registration successful! Welcome to ElevateBid!"

AVAILABLE ROUTES IN YOUR APP:
- "/" - Home page (NEW REDIRECT DESTINATION)
- "/login" - Login page
- "/register" - Register page  
- "/details/:id" - Product details page
- "/*" - 404 Not Found page

The signup now provides detailed console logging for debugging and redirects users
directly to the home page instead of making them login again after registration.
